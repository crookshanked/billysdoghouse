                <h1>About Billy's</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Welcome to Billy's Dog House, the premier destination in Summerville, SC, for Chicago-style hot dogs that taste like home. Founded by Billy Hough, a Summerville native with a passion for cooking and a love for community, Billy's Dog House is more than just a restaurant; it's a place where friends and family come together to enjoy good food and great company.</p>
        
            <p>Billy's journey into the culinary world began at a young age, inspired by his family's gatherings and his desire to bring joy to people through food. After years of honing his skills and perfecting his recipes, Billy decided to share his love for the Chicago-style hot dog with his hometown. Thus, Billy's Dog House was born.</p>
            
            <p>At Billy's Dog House, we're committed to using only the highest quality ingredients, from our ViennaÂ® Beef hot dogs to our freshly baked buns and hand-picked toppings. Our menu is a tribute to the classic Chicago-style hot dog, with a few innovative twists that Billy himself has created.</p>
            
            <p>When he's not behind the grill, Billy enjoys exploring the beautiful landscapes of South Carolina, fishing in the local rivers, and spending time with his family and dogs. He believes in giving back to the community that has supported him, participating in local events and hosting fundraisers for various causes.</p>
            
            <p>Stop by Billy's Dog House to experience the warmth and deliciousness that only Billy can bring to a hot dog. We look forward to serving you!</p>
